# Project Structure

Projects in StatWrap are collections of resources that are loosely grouped together.

## Project List

### Overview

The project list is something specific to the _user_ of StatWrap. This is their personal collection of projects that they are interested in, and we do not anticipate that this list is something that is going to be shared with other users. As such, the data collected in the project list will include preferences of the user (e.g., if a project is a `favorite`), as well as actions taken by the user (e.g., `lastAccessed`).

Note that the `path` is also considered something specific to the user. While a project path could be shared - a URL, a shared file server - we also have local projects that might get shipped around. The `path` attribute will capture where the root of the project exists for this user.

### File Location

The list of projects will be stored in the user's application data folder, in a file named `.statwrap-projects.json`. The application data directory will be found using [Electron's `app.getPath('userData')`](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/app#appgetpathname).

### Attributes

| Item           | Type                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`           | String                  | A unique identifier (UUID) generated by StatWrap when you created your project                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `name`         | String                  | The descriptive name of the project. This will default to part of the path where the project is located                                                                                                                                            |
| `favorite`     | bool                    | Has the user flagged this as one of their favorite projects.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `lastAccessed` | Date/Time<sup>[1]</sup> | The last date and time that the project was opened by the user within StatWrap. Used to populate the list of recent projects                                                                                                                       |
| `path`         | String                  | This will ideally be a URI that resolves to some location where the project contents are contained. StatWrap will assume this is a file path unless an explicit protocol is provided. Note that as of now, only file-based projects are supported. |

## Project

### Overview

StatWrap approaches projects as having one higher-level container that serves as the base for the project. For most projects this will be a folder, but we will refer to it here as a "container" just to provide a more general name. Not everything must live in that container, it is just the unit of organization that StatTag uses. The project file then provides the metadata to describe the project, and can be shipped along with the project even if the recipient doesn't use StatWrap.

### File Location

For each project, within the root of the project container, there will be a file called `.statwrap-project.json`.
