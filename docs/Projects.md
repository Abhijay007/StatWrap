| `name`         | String                  | The descriptive name of the project. This will default to part of the path where the project is located                                                                                                                                            |
| `favorite`     | bool                    | Has the user flagged this as one of their favorite projects.                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| `path`         | String                  | This will ideally be a URI that resolves to some location where the project contents are contained. StatWrap will assume this is a file path unless an explicit protocol is provided. Note that as of now, only file-based projects are supported. |
