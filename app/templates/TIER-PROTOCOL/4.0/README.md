# The Read Me File

The **Read Me file** is a user's guide to the documentation stored in your **Project/** folder.

When a reader is interested in exploring your documentation or reproducing the results of your project, the Read Me file is the first thing they will look at.

See [https://www.projecttier.org/tier-protocol/protocol-4-0/root/readme/](https://www.projecttier.org/tier-protocol/protocol-4-0/root/readme/) for more information.
